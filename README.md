# LaptopPricePredict
A Machine Learning Model built for predicting Laptop Price Based on Specs input by users  

## Data
The data used in this project could be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/owm4096/laptop-prices  
This Data contains Specifications of Laptops and it's price, consisting 1.275 rows and 23 columns

## Model
In this Project, I build Machine Learning Models using KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting.  
Based on their Performance, XGBoosting has the best result, then I did hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost to further improve it's performance
